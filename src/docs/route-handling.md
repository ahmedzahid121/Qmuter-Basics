# Route Handling Comparison: Uber Route Share vs. Qmuter

## 1. Route Handling (Routing & Stops)
Uber Route Share is pre-scheduled and fixed-route, similar to a shuttle bus system.

Riders select from designated pickup and drop-off points, not custom addresses.

Uber uses routing algorithms to:

* Create efficient, recurring routes (based on demand clusters)
* Adjust routing slightly depending on traffic and bookings

Riders may need to walk 1–3 minutes to their stop.

Like a bus, the driver does not deviate to each rider’s doorstep — it’s optimized for time and scale.

**Contrast:** In Qmuter, routes are peer-to-peer and dynamic, based on real-time route similarity.

## 2. Rider–Driver Interaction
Minimal direct interaction is expected.

The app handles:

* Rider’s seat reservation
* Estimated arrival time
* Assigned driver details (name, car type, license plate)

The driver doesn’t confirm each rider manually — the system automatically assigns riders to scheduled seats.

Uber likely discourages rider-driver messaging unless needed (e.g., if someone is late or can't find the stop).

## 3. Live Location Sharing
Riders can see:

* Real-time shuttle location on a map (just like UberX)
* Estimated arrival at pickup point

Drivers also get:

* List of upcoming stops
* Number of passengers onboard or at each stop

All location tracking uses Uber’s core GPS tracking and ETA algorithms (same as in UberX and Uber Pool).

## 4. Messaging / Notifications
Communication is automated and minimal:

* App sends alerts like “Your ride is 3 minutes away” or “Your shuttle has arrived”

Riders can message the driver only if:

* The ride is active
* The situation calls for it (e.g., rider is lost or late)

Messaging is likely in-app and one-way limited, to avoid unnecessary delays or confusion.
